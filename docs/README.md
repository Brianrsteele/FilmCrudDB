# FilmDB ##

## What does FilmDB do? ##

FilmDB is a CRUD database intended to catalog what kinds of analog photography film is still available for purchase in the US. Currently, the database only lists some varieties of 35mm film, the film's manufacturer, and the development process.

Goals for the near term include:

* Expanding the funcionality to include all CRUD operations
* Tracking film formats as well as types
* Tracking film prices at several photography web sites

Goals for the long term include:

* Tracking businesses that are still processing film, including web sites, price, and film formats/development processes.

## Why are you making this? ##

The project is meant as a learning exercise, mostly. It is a chance to implement a CRUD database using Python, Flask, Bootstrap, and Sqlite3. 

## What do I need to run it? ##

This project runs on Python 3.7.11 and will need Flask installed. Sqlite3 comes with the Python standard library.
